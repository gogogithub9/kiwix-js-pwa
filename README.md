# WikiMed Offline Medical Wikipedia

This is a version of the Kiwix JS Offline Wikimedia reader for UWP on Windows 10 that has been packaged with
a WikiMed archive. If you are interested in the development of Kiwix JS, or want to install it without
the packaged archive, please switch back to the Master branch: https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/tree/master.

This app enables offline reading of the packaged ZIM archive, although many other ZIM files may be
downloaded from the Kiwix repository, including WikiMed versions with or without images
in many different languages. The underlying app has only been tested fully on Wikimedia ZIM files to date.

The easiest way to install WikiMed is from the Microsoft Store:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/wikimed/9phjsnp1cz8j

However, if you prefer not to use the Store, or want to test a specific release, available packages are located under Releases: https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/releases. Installation instructions for the standalone app (Kiwix JS) are provided on the Master branch: https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/tree/master.

Short answer:

	WikiMed Offline Medical Wikipedia UWP works entirely offline unless you specifically request otherwise on the 
	Configuration page. We do not collect any of your personal data and don't even know what you are doing with this 
	application.

Longer answer:

	WikiMed Offline Medical Wikipedia UWP will only access the Kiwix download server if you specifically request it to 
	find and display download links for ZIM archives on the Configuration page.
    
	You can disable even this Internet access with an option on the same page. If you nevertheless believe your
	Internet access can be watched and/or if you are extremely cautious, you should shut down your 3G and WiFi
	access before using the application.
    
	This application only reads the archive files contained in the app or those that you download and select: it is not
	capable of reading any other files.

	By default, this application will remember your last-visited page between sessions using a local cookie that
	is accessible only by this app on this device. If you are accessing sensitive information that you do not wish
	to be displayed next time you open this app, we recommend that you turn this option off in the Configuration page.
