# Kiwix JS Wikivoyage for Windows

This is a version of the Kiwix Offline Wikimedia reader for UWP on Windows 10 that has been packaged with
a Wikivoyage archive. If you are interested in the development of Kiwix JS, or want to install it without
the packaged archive, please switch back to the Master branch: https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/tree/master

This app enables offline reading of the packaged ZIM archive, although many other ZIM files may be
downloaded from the Kiwix repository, including full Wikipedia versions with or without images
in many different languages. The underlying app has only been tested fully on Wikimedia ZIM files to date.

Installation instructions for the standalone app are provided on the Master branch: https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/tree/master.
If there are packages for sideloading this Wikivoyage branch, they will be located under Releases: https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js-windows/releases

Short answer:

	Kiwix JS Wikivoyage UWP works entirely offline unless you specifically request otherwise on the Configuration page.
	We do not collect any of your personal data and don't even know what you are doing with this application.

Longer answer:

	Kiwix JS Wikivoyage UWP will only access the Kiwix download server if you specifically request it to find and display
	download links for ZIM archives on the Configuration page.
    
	You can disable even this Internet access with an option on the same page. If you nevertheless believe your
	Internet access can be watched and/or if you are extremely cautious, you should shut down your 3G and WiFi
	access before using the application.
    
	This application only reads the archive files of your device: it is not capable of reading any other files.
